            <br/><br/>I am a 22 year old young man, living in New York and working as a Web Developer. I have a history or working at large and small companies, but my number one priority is to get my work done professionally and effectively.

            <br/><br/>For some of my history, I was born in New York, but grew up in Los Angeles, California. A sweet but introverted boy,  I spent most of my free time during my developmental years on online communities growing really familiar with online culture. In other words, a total geek.

            <br/><br/>I developed hobbies in writing, art, and image editing at this time, but I was always rather intimidating by the process of coding. Even something as simple as messing with a profile’s CSS was daunting to me back then.

            <br/><br/>Not knowing quite what I wanted to do with life at that point, I moved back to New York to attend Pace University at 16 to pursue a Biology. (Did I mentioned I skipped two grades) I wasn’t interested in pursuing a medical career like most other Biology majors, but through school I loved science particularly the scientific method and the theory of evolution, so believed this to be a good choice for me.

            <br/><br/>By the time I reached my senior year and attended a few conferences, I decided that Biology was not the thing for me and made the decision to do what I could to pursue computer science. As such I took a few CS courses before I graduated then after graduation I took a Software Testing course at Per Scholas. Thanks to that course I managed to get a job at Doran Jones as a Software Tester beginning my career in the field.

            <br/><br/>The highlight of my time at Doran Jones was being sent to Toronto to do testing on TD Bank’s implementation of Apple Pay in Canada. It was a really fun and exciting experience and despite all the hard work, it was very rewarding and made me very happy with my decision.

            <br/><br/>Unfortunately that contract came to an end and it came time for me to move onto new things. I started working with the Y Combinator startup Squire, preparing and writing automated test scripts for their admin systems. Being forced into a role where I had to write a lot of code, I felt my shortcoming being mostly self taught beyond the classes I took in school. In order to fill my gaps I decided to take a Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

            <br/><br/>There I learned a lot in regards to coding, best practices, and just the different ways you can go about actually making a site. It was a truly fulfilling experience and I am happy to be able to say I am an alumni.

            <br/><br/>This finally brings me to where I am now, a recent graduate looking to give a hand to someone who might just need it.
